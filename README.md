So, the goal of this project is to develop an application to compute points images in the plan after severaltransformations. To make it nice and clean, you chose to use homogeneous coordinates. How clever of you.O being the origin of both axis, here are the transformations to be implemented:  
.Translation,Scaling  
.Rotation centered at O  
.Reflection over any axis that passes through O  
.Any combination of the previous transformations.
